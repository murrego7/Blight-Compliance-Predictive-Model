# Blight Fines Compliance Predictor
**Based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)).** 

Detroit faces the problem of Blight violations (these are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition). Unfortunately, many of the fines issued by the city of Detroit remain unpaid. **"Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?".**

In order to answering this question, we need first to understand when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket.

**Our Goal: Predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.**

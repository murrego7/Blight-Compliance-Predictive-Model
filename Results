**Results**:
I trained the model using the next models 
**K-Nearest Neighbors**: ROC AUC SCORE (0.50)
**Support Vector Machines**: ROC AUC SCORE (0.50)
**Neural Network Model**: ROC AUC SCORE (0.50)
**Random Forest Model**: ROC AUC SCORE **(0.79)**
**Random Forest Model Best Hyperparameters (Grid-Search)**: ROC AUC SCORE **(0.79)**

Noticeably, the Random Forest Model was the most accurate, beyond this, using a hyperparameter optimization tool such as Grid Search improved marginally the results.
